# Work Day Scheduler
Bootcamp Module 5 Code Refactor Challenge - Work Day Scheduler


## Installation

None - Runs in the browser

## Usage

This project was a code refactor challenge that used class source code that can be seen in my second commit "add starter code"
The goal was to make the page dynamically update the color scheme based on actual time and save user inputs to local storage.
For this project, I used jQuery and Dayjs to use live time as a reference. The page updates in relation to the current Dayjs hour.
I also used parent-child DOM navigation and the jQuery 'this' to retrieve elements used in my functions. 
Finally, user inputs were saved and retieved using local storage using the input buttons.
